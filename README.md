I have started this task with utmost enthusiasm. Due to which was able to complete it partially.
Part 2 is fully completed with the accuracy of 99.8%. As the dataset is nicely labelled with 60k image dataset.
But in part 1, I have tried to make a well labelled CSV file of the image dataset by converting the photos into pixels using numpy array. But at the time of dividing the dataset into training and test set there were few errors.
