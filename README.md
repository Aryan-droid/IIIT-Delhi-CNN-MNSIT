# IIIT-Delhi-CNN-MNSIT
Made for IIIT Delhi Summer Internship Task
I have started with task 2 CNN model for Digit Recognisation.

I have used these link to refresh my concept of CNN modelling. This site helped me alot.

I have started this task with utmost enthusiasm. Due to which was able to complete it partially. I have a fair knowleadge about the neural netwroks (Deep learning). All this knowledge is self attained.

Part 1
In this part first I tried to convert the dataset in csv format. As the dataset was not labelled. I have tried to make a well labelled CSV file of the image dataset by converting the photos into pixels using numpy array. 
But at the time of dividing the dataset into training and test set there were few errors. Due to which I was unable to proceed further. But since I have completed the Neural Network with the help of above stated links. Thus successfully completed part 2.

Part 2 is fully completed with the accuracy of 99.8%. As the dataset is nicely labelled with 60k image dataset.
